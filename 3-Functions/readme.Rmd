# Functions and the `apply()` Family

## Writing Functions

In R, functions allow us to perform specific operations on our data. When using a function, it is important to understand its arguments and how they impact the output. Let's start by creating our own function to calculate the mean of a numeric vector.

To create a function, we use the `function()` keyword. We define the parameters of the function inside the parentheses and specify the operations to be performed within the curly braces.

```{r}
myMean <- function(x){
  total_count_of_values <- length(x)
  total_sum_of_values <- sum(x)
  average_of_values <- total_sum_of_values / total_count_of_values
  return(average_of_values)
}
```

In this example, the `myMean()` function takes a numeric vector `x` as input. It calculates the total count of values, the sum of values, and then divides the sum by the count to obtain the average. Finally, it returns the average.

Let's try our function with a sample vector:

```{r}
my_vector <- c(1, 3, 5, 2, 6, 9, 0)
vector_mean <- myMean(x = my_vector)
vector_mean
```

The output should be the average of the numbers in the vector, which in this case is `4`.


## For Loop

For loops in R allow us to repeat an operation a set number of times. The basic structure of a for loop consists of an iterator variable that takes on values from a sequence.

```{r}
for (i in sequence) {
  # operations to be performed
}
```

Here's an example of using a for loop to calculate the average of three vectors using our `myMean()` function:

```{r}
my_list <- list(c(1, 5, 9, 3), 1:10, c(23, 42))
my_averages <- c()
for (i in seq_along(my_list)) {
  my_averages[i] <- myMean(my_list[[i]])
}
my_averages
```

In this case, we iterate over the indices of the `my_list` vector. For each index, we extract the corresponding vector and calculate its average using the `myMean()` function. The resulting averages are stored in the `my_averages` vector.

We can also use a for loop to calculate column-wise means in a data frame. Let's calculate the means of selected columns in the `chicago_air` dataset from the `region5air` package.

```{r}
library(region5air)
data(chicago_air)

columns <- c("ozone", "temp", "solar")
chicago_avgs <- c()

for (col in columns) {
  numeric_series <- chicago_air[[col]]
  numeric_series <- numeric_series[!is.na(numeric_series)]
  chicago_avgs[col] <- mean(numeric_series)
}

chicago_avgs
```

The output will show the means of the selected columns in the `chicago_air` dataset.


## The `apply()` Family

The `apply()` family of functions in R provides an efficient way to apply a function to a vector, list, or column in a data frame. These functions include `apply()`, `lapply()`, `sapply()`, and `tapply()`.

Here's an overview of each function in the `apply()` family:

- `apply()`: Applies a function to a data frame or matrix along a specified margin (rows or columns).
- `lapply()`: Applies a function to each member of a list and returns a list of the results.
- `sapply()`: Similar to `lapply()`, but it simplifies the output as much as possible.
- `tapply()`: Applies a function to subsets of a vector, split by one or more factors.

Let's explore some examples of using the `apply()` family:

```{r}
air <- chicago_air[, c("ozone", "temp", "solar")]

# Using apply() to find the maximum value of each column
air_max <- apply(air, 2, max, na.rm = TRUE)
air_max
```

In this example, we apply the `max()` function to each column of the `air` data frame to find the maximum value. The argument `MARGIN = 2` specifies column-wise application, and `na.rm = TRUE` indicates that `NA` values should be ignored.

```{r}
# Using lapply() to find the length of each vector in a list
lengths <- lapply(my_list, length)
lengths
```

Here, we apply the `length()` function to each element of the `my_list` list to find the length of each vector.

```{r}
# Using sapply() to find the number of NAs in each column of a data frame
na_counts <- sapply(air, function(column) sum(is.na(column)))
na_counts
```

In this example, we use `sapply()` to apply an anonymous function to each column of the `air` data frame. The function checks if each value in the column is `NA`, resulting in a logical vector. We then use `sum()` to count the number of `NA` values in each column.

```{r}
# Using tapply() to find the maximum ozone value by month in the chicago_air dataset
ozone_max_by_month <- tapply(chicago_air$ozone, list(chicago_air$month), max, na.rm = TRUE)
ozone_max_by_month
```

Here, we use `tapply()` to split the `ozone` values in the `chicago_air` dataset by the `month` variable. We then apply the `max()` function to each subset, resulting in the maximum ozone value for each month.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

Write a function called `isAboveThreshold()` that takes two numeric arguments (`x` and `threshold`). The function should return `TRUE` if the value of `x` is above the threshold, and `FALSE` otherwise.

```{r}
isAboveThreshold <- function(x, threshold) {
  x > threshold
}

isAboveThreshold(10, 5)
```

### Exercise 2

Use a for loop to check each value in the random vector `rnorm(n = 10, mean = 35, sd = 10)` and determine if it is above a threshold of `35`. Store the results in a logical vector.

```{r}
set.seed(22)
random_vector <- rnorm(n = 10, mean = 35, sd = 10)

above_threshold <- logical(length(random_vector))

for (i in seq_along(random_vector)) {
  above_threshold[i] <- isAboveThreshold(random_vector[i], 35)
}

data.frame(random_vector, above_threshold)
```

### Exercise 3

Use the `sapply()` function to find out how many days in the `chicago_air` dataset had an 8-hour ozone value above `0.075` ppm.

```{r}
isAboveThreshold_ozone <- function(x) {
  isAboveThreshold(x, 0.075)
}

ozone_above_threshold <- sum(sapply(chicago_air$ozone, isAboveThreshold_ozone))
ozone_above_threshold
```

### Exercise 4

Use the `mapply()` function to find out how many days in the `chicago_air` dataset had an 8-hour ozone value above `0.075`, how many days had a temperature above `90`, and how many days had a solar radiation value above `1.25`. Define suitable threshold functions for each variable.

```{r}
above_threshold_count <- mapply(
  function(value, threshold) {
    sum(sapply(value, isAboveThreshold, threshold))
  },
  list(chicago_air$ozone, chicago_air$temp, chicago_air$solar),
  c(0.075, 90, 1.25)
)

above_threshold_count
```
