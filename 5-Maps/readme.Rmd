# Maps

In this tutorial, we'll cover the following topics:

* [Basic Maps](#basic)
* [Google Maps](#google)
* [Leaflet Maps](#leaflet)

## Basic Maps {#basic}

To create maps in R, we will use the `maps` package. Let's start by creating a simple map of Indiana.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(maps)
map(database = 'state', regions = 'indiana')
```

Next, let's add air quality monitors as points on the map. We will use the longitude column as the x-axis values and latitude for the y-axis values.

```{r}
monitors <- read.table(header=T, text='
  monitorid        lat        long   datum                    name            
          1   41.60668  -87.304729   WGS84              Gary-IITRI
          2  39.811097	-86.114469   WGS84  Indpls-Washington-Park
          3  39.749019	-86.186314   WGS84      Indpls-Harding-St.
          4  38.013248	-87.577856   WGS84  Evansville-Buena-Vista
          5  39.159383	-86.504762   WGS84             Bloomington
          6  39.997484  -86.395172   WGS84              Whitestown
                       ')
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
map(database = 'state', regions = 'indiana')
points(x = monitors$long, y = monitors$lat)
```

We can make the map more informative by displaying it as a county map and changing the symbol type and color.

```{r}
map(database = 'county', regions = 'indiana')
points(x = monitors$long, y = monitors$lat, pch = 19, col = 'red')
```

If we want to label the counties, we can use the `map.text` function.

```{r}
map.text(database = 'county', regions = 'indiana')
points(x = monitors$long, y = monitors$lat, pch = 19, col = 'red')
```

To label the monitors, we can use the `text()` function.

```{r}
map(database = 'county', regions = 'indiana')
points(x = monitors$long, y = monitors$lat, pch = 19, col = 'red')
text(x = monitors$long, y = monitors$lat, labels = monitors$name, pos = 2)
```

## Google Maps {#google}

To create interactive Google maps, we can use the `googleVis` package.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(googleVis)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
op <- options(gvis.plot.tag='chart')
```

First, we need to format the coordinates in the `monitors` data frame.

```{r, results='asis', tidy=FALSE}
google.location <- paste(monitors$lat, monitors$long, sep = ":")
monitors.google <- data.frame(monitors, google.location)
g.inter.map <- gvisMap(data = monitors.google, locationvar = "google.location",
                       tipvar = "name")
plot(g.inter.map)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
options(op)
```

## Leaflet Maps {#leaflet}

Another interactive map option is Leaflet, which can be created in R using the `leaflet` package.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
library(leaflet)
m <- leaflet()
m <- addTiles(m)
m <- addMarkers(m, lng=monitors$long, lat=monitors$lat, 
                popup=monitors$name)
m
```

## Exercises

### Exercise 1

Use `dplyr` to summarize the `no2` data frame so that each monitor has one record with a column for the NO~2~ mean for the entire year and a column for the standard deviation.

### Exercise 2

Use the data frame created in Exercise 1 to create a map of the monitors.

### Exercise 3

Subset the data frame created in Exercise 1 to include only the monitors in Ohio. Plot these monitors on a map and label them with the "City.Name" column.

### Exercise 4

Use `googleVis` to create a Google map of the monitors in Ohio.

### Exercise 5

Use `leaflet` to create a Leaflet map of the monitors in Ohio.
