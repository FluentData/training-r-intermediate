This tutorial will cover how to merge data frames using base R and `dplyr`. Merging data frames is an essential skill for air quality data analysts working with R. This guide will provide a step-by-step explanation of the merging process, demonstrate the use of different merging techniques, and highlight the advantages of using `dplyr` for data merging.

## Introduction {#introduction}

Data merging is the process of combining two or more data frames into a single data frame based on common columns. It allows analysts to integrate data from multiple sources and perform comprehensive analysis. In this guide, we will explore two approaches to merging data frames in R: base R and `dplyr`. 

## Merging with Base R {#base-r}

In base R, the `merge()` function is used to merge data frames. It requires one or more common columns between the two tables. 

### Inner Join {#inner-join}

The inner join returns only the records that have matching values in the specified columns of both data frames. 

As an example, let's merge the `airdata` dataset and the AQS States table based on the "state" column.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(region5air)

data(airdata)

merged_inner <- merge(airdata, aqs_states)
head(merged_inner)
```

### Left Join {#left-join}

The left join returns all the records from the left data frame (first argument of `merge()`) and the matched records from the right data frame based on the specified columns.

```{r}
merged_left <- merge(airdata, aqs_states, all.x = TRUE)
head(merged_left)
```

### Right Join {#right-join}

The right join returns all the records from the right data frame (second argument of `merge()`) and the matched records from the left data frame based on the specified columns.

```{r}
merged_right <- merge(airdata, aqs_states, all.y = TRUE)
head(merged_right)
```

### Full Join {#full-join}

The full join returns all the records from both data frames, merging on the specified columns.

```{r}
merged_full <- merge(airdata, aqs_states, all = TRUE)
head(merged_full)
```

## Merging with dplyr {#dplyr}

The `dplyr` package provides a set of functions that can perform all the merging operations covered in base R. 

### Inner Join {#inner-join-dplyr}

The `inner_join()` function in `dplyr` performs an inner join between two data frames based on the specified columns.

```{r}
library(dplyr)

merged_inner_dplyr <- inner_join(airdata, aqs_states, by = c("state" = "State.Code"))
head(merged_inner_dplyr)
```

### Left Join {#left-join-dplyr}

The `left_join()` function in `dplyr` performs a left join between two data frames.

```{r}
merged_left_dplyr <- left_join(airdata, aqs_states, by = c("state" = "State.Code"))
head(merged_left_dplyr)
```

### Full Join {#full-join-dplyr}

The `full_join()` function in `dplyr` performs a full join between two data frames.

```{r}
merged_full_dplyr <- full_join(airdata, aqs_states, by = c("state" = "State.Code"))
head(merged_full_dplyr)
```

## Filtering Joins with dplyr {#filtering-joins}

`dplyr` provides additional functions for filtering data frames based on the contents of another data frame.

### Semi Join {#semi-join}

The `semi_join()` function returns only the records from the first data frame that have a matching record in the second data frame.

```{r}
merged_semi <- semi_join(aqs_states, airdata, by = c("State.Code" = "state"))
head(merged_semi)
```

### Anti Join {#anti-join}

The `anti_join()` function returns only the records from the first data frame that do not have a matching record in the second data frame.

```{r}
merged_anti <- anti_join(airdata, aqs_states, by = c("state" = "State.Code"))
head(merged_anti)
```

## Exercises {#exercises}

These exercises will test your understanding of merging techniques in R.

1. Use the `merge()` function to merge the `airdata` dataset with the AQS Units table found at [https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/codes/data/Units.csv](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/codes/data/Units.csv).

2. Do the same merge described in Exercise 1, but use the `inner_join()` function from the `dplyr` package.

3. Subset the AQS State and County Code table ([https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/codes/data/StateCountyCodes.csv](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/codes/data/StateCountyCodes.csv)) to include only the counties that have monitors in the `airdata` dataset. Use the `semi_join()` function from `dplyr`.

4. Subset the AQS Criteria table ([https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/codes/data/Parameters-CRITERIA.csv](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/codes/data/Parameters-CRITERIA.csv)) to include only the parameters that are not present in the `airdata` dataset. Use the `anti_join()` function from `dplyr`.

### Solutions

#### Exercise 1

```{r}
merged_units <- merge(airdata, aqs_units, by.x = "unit", by.y = "Unit")
head(merged_units)
```

#### Exercise 2

```{r}
merged_units_dplyr <- inner_join(airdata, aqs_units, by = c("unit" = "Unit"))
head(merged_units_dplyr)
```

#### Exercise 3

```{r}
counties_with_monitors <- semi_join(aqs_states, airdata, by = c("State.Code" = "state"))
head(counties_with_monitors)
```

#### Exercise 4

```{r}
missing_parameters <- anti_join(aqs_criteria, airdata, by = c("Parameter.Code" = "parameter"))
head(missing_parameters)
```
