# Space-Time Data Analysis in R

In this tutorial, we will explore the analysis of space-time data in R using the `spacetime` package. Space-time data involves studying the variation of a variable not only across different locations but also over time. We will learn how to create `ST*` objects, plot space-time data, and perform interpolation. This tutorial assumes a basic understanding of R and spatial data analysis.

## Introduction to `ST*` Objects{#ST-objects}

In the previous tutorial, we worked with `Spatial*` objects from the `sp` package to represent spatial data. However, those objects did not include information about the data over time. The `spacetime` package provides the `ST*` objects to handle space-time data.

`ST` objects contain spatial and temporal information and serve as the foundation for more complex space-time objects. To create an `ST` object, we need spatial points and corresponding time information. Let's create a simple `ST` object representing two points over two time intervals.

```{r}
library(sp)
library(spacetime)

# Create time intervals
dates <- as.Date('2008-01-01')+1:2
dates

# Define spatial locations
my_matrix <- cbind(c(0,1),c(0,1))
my_matrix

# Create SpatialPoints object
spatial_points <- SpatialPoints(my_matrix)

# Create ST object
st_object <- ST(sp = spatial_points, 
                time = dates, 
                endTime = delta(dates))
st_object
```

The `delta()` function finds the `endTime` for regularly spaced time intervals. In this case, the time interval is a full day, so the `endTime` slot shows that the end time for 2008-01-02 is 2008-01-03, and the end time for 2008-01-03 is 2008-01-04.

The `ST` object forms the basis for more complex space-time layouts like `STF` (full-grid), `STS` (sparse-grid), `STI` (irregular), and `STT` (trajectory). For this tutorial, we will focus on the `STF` layout, which is commonly used in air quality monitoring.

## Plotting Space-Time Data{#plotting-space-time-data}

To visualize space-time data, we can use various plot types such as line plots, maps, and animations. Let's explore plotting the `STFDF` object, which stands for a Space-Time Full-grid-layout Data Frame. 

Before that, let's prepare the data. We will use a subset of the `airdata` dataset, focusing on 1-hour ozone measurements from three monitors, recorded over a four-hour period on June 1, 2013.

```{r}
library(region5air)
library(dplyr)

# Load airdata
data(airdata)
as.tbl(airdata)

# Convert datetime column to posixct
airdata$datetime <- as.POSIXct(airdata$datetime, 
                               tz = "US/Central",
                               format = "%Y%m%dT%H%M")

# Subset data for ozone measurements and three monitors
monitors <- unique(airdata$site)[1:3]
ozone_data <- filter(airdata, 
                     parameter == 44201, 
                     site %in% monitors)

# Choose minimum poc for each monitor and time point
ozone_data <- group_by(ozone_data, site, datetime)
ozone_data <- filter(ozone_data, poc == min(poc))

# Subset data for June 1, 2013, between 11:00 AM and 2:00 PM
min_time <- as.POSIXct("2013-06-01 11:00:00", tz = "US/Central")
max_time <- as.POSIXct("2013-06-01 14:00:00", tz = "US/Central")
ozone_data <- filter(ozone_data, 
                     datetime >= min_time, 
                     datetime <= max_time)

# Select relevant columns
ozone_data <- select(ozone_data, 
                     site, datetime, value, lon, lat, GISDatum)

ozone_data
```

Now let's create an `STFDF` object using the `stConstruct()` function.

```{r}
# Convert air data to data frame
ozone_data <- as.data.frame(ozone_data)

# Create STFDF object
ozone_stfdf <- stConstruct(ozone_data, 
                           space = c("lon", "lat"),
                           time = "datetime",
                           crs = CRS("+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84"))

ozone_stfdf
```

By using appropriate visualization functions, we can further analyze and explore the space-time data.

## Interpolation of Space-Time Data{#interpolation-of-space-time-data}

Interpolation allows us to estimate the values of a variable at unsampled locations or times based on observed data. The `spacetime` package provides interpolation functions specifically designed for space-time data. Let's use the `sptial` function to interpolate ozone measurements at unsampled locations.

```{r}
# Perform interpolation
interp_data <- spatial(ozone_stfdf, 
                       formula = value ~ 1, 
                       method = "autoKrige")

interp_data
```

The resulting interpolated `STFDF` object contains the estimated ozone values at the unsampled locations.

## Exercises{#exercises}

1. Create an `STI` object using irregularly spaced points and time intervals.
2. Plot the space-time data using a map representation.
3. Perform a different interpolation method on the `STFDF` object and compare the results.
4. Calculate the mean ozone value for each monitor across all time points.
